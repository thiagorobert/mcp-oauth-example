My learning path path:
- oauth againt github oauth app
- MCP example: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server (and client)
- MCP against github (stdio)
- test with Claude CLI, Claude Desktop
- RFC7591 (OAuth dynamic clients)
   - Auth0 to test
- Flask server + Auth0 + MCP (stdio)
   - Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI)
- Good doc: https://simplescraper.io/blog/how-to-mcp#transport-protocols-streamable-http-vs-http-sse
- FastMCP v2: https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp?tab=readme-ov-file (which has integrated OAuth?)
   - for HTTPs: https://gofastmcp.com/deployment/self-hosted
